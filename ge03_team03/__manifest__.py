        K'awiil Motors names all of their motorcycles based on the make, model, and year. They don't want to do this for every motorcycle they create, and want it to be computed automatically. But they do not want this to happen on other non-motorcycle products they sell. 
        Specifications 
        Set the "name" field on product.template to be computed in the format of "year make model" for all motorcycle products. 
        Suggested Steps/Hints
        Brush up on computed fields. Make sure to set the correct dependencies on api.depends.""",
